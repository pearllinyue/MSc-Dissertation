"Note:1.Since 1980, the difference between the Gross Domestic Product and the Gross National Income (formerly, the Gross National Product) is the net factor income from the rest of the world."
"　　　2.The classification by the three strata of industry is based on the ?Regulation on the Classification by Three Strata of Industry? made by the National Bureau of Statistics in 2012. The primary industry refers to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery industries (except support services to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery industries). The secondary industry refers to mining (except auxiliary activities of mining), manufacturing (except repairs for metal products, machinery and equipment), production and supply of electricity, steam, gas and water, and construction. The tertiary industry refers to all other industries not included in primary or secondary industry."
"　　　3.According to China?s regulations on the GDP revisions and international practice, systematic revisions are made on the GDP figures for 2012 and earlier years with the revised 2013 GDP data and other historical data. The revisions made include three areas: the first is the revision of the GDP figures for 2012 and earlier years following the revisions of the National Industrial Classification of Economic Activities and the Classification by Three Strata of Industry; the second is the revision of the GDP figures for 2009-2012 with the data from the third economic census available; and the third is the revision of the value-added of financial intermediation for 2008 and earlier years due to the methodological changes in calculating the value-added of financial intermediation."
